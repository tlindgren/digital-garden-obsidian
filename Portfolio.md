# Portfolio
This is where I document past work I've done.

***Currently under active (re)construction*.**

## Goals
- To represent my work experience more **holistically** (in a way that a resume wouldn't)
- To use the **[[digital garden]]** format as a reflective process to revisit previous work and make links between past and present. 

## Getting Started
- **[[Writings]]**
- **[[Presentations]]**
- **[[Selected Web Development Projects]]**
- **Doctoral [[Dissertation]]**: Place Blogging: Local Economies of Attention in the Network
- **[[Canvas UI Design]]**: Theme design and product management
- **Recent Photography**:  [View on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/timothylindgren)
- **Past Video Projects**: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/timlindgren)
