# Design Tools
 [Design Tools](https://cidilabs.com/landing/design-tools/) is an add-on to the [[Canvas]] learning management system designed to enhance the existing WYSIWYG editor.
 
 We use it for [[Canvas UI Design]] to give online programs a consistent look and feel across courses and to provide learning designers and faculty more options for design their Canvas sites.
