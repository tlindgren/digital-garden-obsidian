# digital garden
note status: early draft

A digital garden is public collection of [[networked note-making|networked notes]] meant to be cultivated over time and take shape organically as one's thinking evolves.  

It seems it's often used to distinguish private digital notes from a public version, but it's not always used consistently this way. 

I like the way Erica Xu, co-founder of [[Garden/Obsidian]], summarizes what some of the benefits of digital gardening are: 
> I think digital gardening is a great way to produce content on your way to learn. In contrast with traditional blogging, it’s less scary and has less friction. it doesn’t get outdated easily like a blog does, and you can make incremental changes instead of churning out blog posts every week.

Andy Matuschak's version is pretty famous now for it's particular horizontal panes format and for his definition of [[evergreen notes]].
