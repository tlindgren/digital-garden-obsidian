# working in public

One of the main goals for this [[digital garden]] is to learn to get better at [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu), as [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) describes it. I've also been inspired by Austin Kleon's work, particularly [Show Your Work!](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/). 

It doesn't come naturally for me, and it's going to take deliberate practice to get comfortable being in process and building it into my daily ways of working and thinking.
