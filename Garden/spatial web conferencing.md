# spatial web conferencing
An emerging genre of web conferencing that features spatial affordances such as proximity and movement. 

These platforms makes it easier to have synchronous experiences that break out of the grid + breakout room format of typical tools like Zoom.

## Examples: 

- [InSpace](https://inspace.chat/#home)
	- designed for education
	- easy to move between breakout rooms and the main room
	- spatial audio - moving closer or further from another participant affects the audio level
- [Kumospace](https://www.kumospace.com/)
	- has lots of layouts that mimic places (living rooms, offices, etc)
- [Around ](https://www.around.co/)
	- features an audio technology that allows people to be on the platform in the same room and not get feedback
	- designed to make hybrid synchronous collaboration easier 
- [Remo](https://remo.co/)
	- designed for conferences
- [[Sprout]] 
	- flexible shared spaces that combine spacial web conferencing with digital whiteboards
