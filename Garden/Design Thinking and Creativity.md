# Design Thinking and Creativity
I'm preparing to teach a new course on "Design Thinking and Creativity" in the  [Applied Liberal Arts Bachelor's Degree](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/wcas/undergraduate/bachelors/ala.html) in the Woods College of Advancing Studies at Boston College. 

It's been a while since I taught last ([[Teaching Experience]]) so this is an experiment to see what teaching means to mean at this point in my career, particularly since I've been on the other side of things as an learning designer in my [[Work]] for so long.
