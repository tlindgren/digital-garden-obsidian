# 2021-09-22 Updates
Most of my time since my initial re-launch of the site has been taking up by prepping for my spring 2022 [[Design Thinking and Creativity]] course, which is exciting but a huge amount of work.

Here are a few recent updates: 
- added [[Teaching Experience]] to [[Portfolio]] to begin listing my past courses.
- added a page for [[spatial web conferencing]] since I'm exploring options for [[Work]] and my own teaching
- added a page for [[networked note-making|networked notes]] to gather some initial resources for a few folks who were interested

I'm observing as I finish this how long it can take to just get basic pages cleaned up and ready to publish, partly because:
1) I'm just getting in the habit of [[working in public]] and 
2) it's can be hard to publish a note if it links to several non-public notes that are not ready to go live. It can set off a whole cascade of linked notes and it can cause some friction in getting things out the door. 

As I do this more, I think I'll just need to be comfortable with having links to unpublished notes ([[Obsidian Publish]] allows me to style them differently), unless I need to include a directly link to an external site.
