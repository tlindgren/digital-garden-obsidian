# networked note-making
note status: early draft

Working definition: A link-driven approach to cultivating [[evergreen notes]] that keep evolving and growing over time. I think of it as the private note-making practice that might eventually lead to a public [[digital garden]] if you decide to share some of the notes. 

[Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) was my entry point to this style of tool 
and it set me on an entirely new path for note-taking, writing, and thinking. Now I'm using [[Garden/Obsidian]], but the basic approach is similar.

**Key idea for me:** let links be the basic organizing principle of collecting and organizing notes (rather than folder hierarchies and tags). This allows thinking to evolve organically and in associative ways - more in alignment with the way our brains work. 

The pay-off: getting "[compound interest on your thoughts](https://nesslabs.com/conor-white-sullivan-interview)," as Conor White-Sullivan, the founder of Roam, puts it.  
## Basic Affordances
In my view, these are the basic features need for a tool to support networked note-taking: 
- **Easy to make links:** all you have to do is use wikilinks (double brackets [[ ]]) and an autocomplete dropdown helps you select an existing note. 
- **Easy to make notes:** if you create a link to a note that doesn't exist, clicking on that note creates a new note.
- **Easy to see how notes are related:** [bi-directional linking](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals) creates an automatic list of any notes link to given note. 
- **Easy to maintain links:** if you change a title, it automatically update all links referencing that note
- **Easy to link to parts of notes**: you can link to blocks and headings in other pages, not just entire notes

These are other common and very useful features that many tools have: 
- **transclusion:** the ability to embed parts of one page in another (and sometimes entire pages in other pages)
- **a graph** showing a visual and interactive representation of your interconnected notes
- **data queries:** a framework for making more complex data queries to mine your notes for insights

## A Rough List of Networked Note-Making Tools
- [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) 
- [[Garden/Obsidian]] - what I'm currently using
- [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) - A local-first open-source knowledge Roam-style tool 
-  [RemNote](https://www.remnote.io/)- A Roam Research-style tool that features spaced repetition. Geared towards students
- Integrates calendars and task management
	- [Organizedly](https://www.organized.ly/)	
	- [Amplenote](https://www.amplenote.com/)
	- [Noteplan](https://noteplan.co/) - markdown-based, Mac/IOS only
- Other interesting variations
	- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product?fredir=1) - a unique combination of notes and spreadsheets/databases; also has bi-directional linking
	-  [Craft](https://www.craft.do/) - card-based, interlinked documents; Mac-oriented

New tools seem to pop up all the time so, for a way to explore and compare a number of these apps, see: [NoteApps.info: 24 best note taking apps analyzed over 273 features](https://www.noteapps.info/)
