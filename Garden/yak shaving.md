# yak shaving
A form of procrastination involving a sequence of contrived tasks that must be completed in order to begin the actual work. 

Jeremy H. Brown defined it this way: 
 > “What you are doing when you’re doing some stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what you’re supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal relations links what you’re doing to the original meta-task.” - 

This a distortion of what is typically meant by "sharpening your ax": If you don't take time for self-improvement and self-care, you will just end up working harder but accomplishing less. 

But this impulse for self-improvement can morph into procrastination if we let tangential tasks morph into prerequisites to the actual work we need to do.  

This quote describes it vividly: 

 > “To sharpen the axe, you need a sharpening stone… But to get there, you need to build a dog sled… But to use a dog sled I need snow, so I need to go to town to get a snow cone machine. I grab my trusty yak to help you haul the machine from town. But it’ll be summer before I get to town, and I don’t want the yak to get to hot, so I shave the yak. In mid February, I proudly lead my shining, bald, shivering yak into my quarterly progress review…”

For me, working on my website (or trying out personal productive apps will also fit the bill...) is the ultimate path to yak shaving. Instead of actually creating content for the site, I will almost always convince myself that I need to rebuild it in order to try out a new platform/framework (the latest iteration was Gatsby). 

So in my current iteration, I'm trying out a tactic designed to keep me from fiddling: choosing a platform that has most of the features I need but is only minimally extensible (Obsidian Publish). See [[About this Site]] for more on this.  

I've still managed to spend a few late nights messing with the CSS but I think I've mostly gotten that out of my system for now (yes, I could add a js file, but thankfully there isn't a huge collection of plugins to make it easy).  

The first step is to admit I have a problem, and this is my way to set up guardrails to make it easier for me to work directly on the real project: to develop a habit of doing more work in public by developing a [[digital garden]] that actually has a chance to grow.
