# About this Site
This is a [[digital garden]] made up of interconnected notes. It's where I'm practicing [[working in public]] and sharing what I'm learning. 

It's definitely a work in progress at the moment since I just launched a new version ([[2021-08-21 Updates]]).

## How It's Organized
There are a few features to help you navigate: 
- **bi-directional linking**: at the bottom of most pages, you'll see a list of pages that think to this page
- **knowledge graph:** on the right (on desktop screens), you'll see a visual representation of how notes are connected

The [[Notes Overview|Notes]] page also has some ways to get started exploring. 

## Platform
I'm using [[Garden/Obsidian Publish]] because I already use [[Garden/Obsidian]] heavily as my person knowledge management system. I also have a bad habit of spending too much time rebuilding and fiddling with my website (rather than actually creating content) See [[yak shaving]].
