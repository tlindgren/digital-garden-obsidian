# Obsidian
Note Status: rough draft

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is the [[networked note-making]] tool that I'm using for my private notes. I'm also using [[Obsidian Publish]] to share a subset of notes publicly in a [[digital garden]].

## A Few Thing I Like About Obsidian
- based on local-first markdown pages
- page-oriented editing style rather than outline-based
- easy-to-use library of plug-ins
- easy to tweak the css and understand the theming
- ability to use both folders and links to organize
- mobile apps
- service for publishing a digital garden if I didn't want to develop a custom website

## Quotes
 [A Beginner's Guide to Obsidian | Work Life Win Repeat](https://www.worklifewinrepeat.com/beginners-guide-obsidian/)
> Networked note-taking is the research-backed notion that ideas are born when they are recorded and allowed to freely interact in an interconnected environment.
> Obsidian refers to themselves as a note-taking platform with “links as a first-class citizen”.

## Customizations
- **WYSIWYG CSS Snippet:** I don't mind working in markdown but I prefer not having to toggle between the edit and preview modes to see a more finished looking page. To tide me over until Obsidian adds an actual Typora-style WYSIWYG editor (it's on the roadmap), I cobbled together a css snippet that hides the markdown when I'm not clicking on an element.
	- To enable it, place [this file](https://github.com/tlindgren/digital-garden-obsidian/tree/main/.obsidian/snippets) the "Snippets" folder in the .obsidian directory and enable CSS snippets in the Appearance section of Obsidian.
	- Note: the behavior around links can be a little trick you try to edit content in a block with a link in it.
